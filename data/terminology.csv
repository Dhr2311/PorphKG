PKG0001,pathology,osteodystrophy,2064845,"Osteodystrophy is a general term for poor bone development or disease, here not referring to renal osteodystrophy in CEP (ID for renal osteodystrophy D012080)"
PKG0002,pathology,nonhemochromatotic disorders,16315139,"Non-HFE hemochromatosis is a descriptive, collective term for rare types of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) caused by mutations in other specific iron-regulating genes"
PKG0003,chemical entity,plasma porphyrins,34245225,"Total plasma porphyrins measure levels of these light-sensitive compounds in the blood, primarily used to help diagnose and monitor porphyrias, especially cutaneous types like Porphyria Cutanea Tarda (PCT), and to investigate unexplained photosensitivity or kidney issues, with elevated levels indicating disruptions in heme synthesis."
PKG0004,chemical entity,erythrocyte porphyrins,34245225,"Total erythrocyte porphyrins (TEP) measure the porphyrin compounds in red blood cells, primarily protoporphyrin, indicating heme production issues, often screened for iron deficiency, lead poisoning, and specific porphyrias like EPP/XLP, by reflecting disruptions in iron incorporation or heme synthesis, with elevated levels suggesting problems like iron deficiency (zinc protoporphyrin up) or protoporphyrias (free protoporphyrin up)"
PKG0005,chemical entity,porphyrin precursors,38456621,"In acute porphyria (AP), neurotoxic porphyrin precursors are produced in the liver and LT is a curative treatment option in patients with recurrent severe neuropathic attacks."
PKG0006,pathology,hepatobillary disease,38456621,"Hepatobiliary disease is a broad term for conditions affecting the liver (hepa-) and the bile system (biliary), including the gallbladder and ducts, covering issues from gallstones and infections (like hepatitis) to cirrhosis and liver cancer, often causing fatigue, pain, jaundice, or abdominal swelling, with causes ranging from viruses, alcohol, genetics, to autoimmune issues."
PKG0007,pathology,mixed HCC- cholangiocarcinoma,38456621,"Mixed HCC-cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-CC) is a rare, aggressive primary liver cancer showing features of both liver cell (hepatocellular) and bile duct (cholangiocarcinoma) cancers, often arising from hepatic stem cells."
PKG0008,chemical entity,uroporphomethene,39644053,"The hepatic UROD protein level remains at its genetically determined level in all types of PCT, but hepatic enzyme activity is reduced to less than about 20% of normal, suggesting the presence of an enzyme inhibitor. Phillips and colleagues identified this inhibitor as a uroporphomethene, probably derived from the partial oxidization of uroporphyrinogen"
PKG0009,pathology,heme deficiency,32487371,Acute porphyrias (AP) are characterized by heme deficiency and induction of hepatic 5-aminole vulinate synthase (ALAS1).
PKG0010,pathology,endothelial damage,32487371,"Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is associated with endothelial damage, neurotoxicity and increased risk for vascular diseases."
PKG0011,biological process,anaplerosis,23492669,"Table: TCA cycle flux | Energy generation, anaplerosis, and amphibolic role."
PKG0012,pathology,photomutilation,2064845,The clinical syndrome is dominated by extreme photosensitivity with mutilation of light exposed extremities and hemolytic anemia.
